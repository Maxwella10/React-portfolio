# Maxwell Acha's React-portfolio


## Overview 
Welcome to the Modern Development with React: React Portfolio project! Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
